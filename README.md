# proj-repo-template
This is my project repo template that I can use for all the deployable codes and share with public for their use



# project notes
- The layer_code folder is an empty or placeholder directory that AWS CDK uses as the source for the bundling process. 
- Dependencies themselves are installed in a Docker container and placed into python/lib/python3.9/site-packages/, then zipped.
